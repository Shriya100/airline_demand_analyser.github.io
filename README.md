Airline Booking Market Demand Analyzer (Static Site Version)
This web application helps to simulate and analyze market demand trends in the airline booking industry, providing insights on popular routes, price trends, and high-demand periods. It's designed for a quick, static site deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages).

Important Security Warning:
This version of the application places the Gemini API key directly in the client-side JavaScript (script.js). This makes your API key publicly visible to anyone who views your website's source code. This is a severe security risk, as anyone can copy and misuse your key.

It is critical that you:

Generate a new, temporary API key specifically for this demonstration.

Immediately revoke or delete this API key from your Google Cloud Console or Gemini API dashboard as soon as your demonstration is complete.

For any long-term or production use, you MUST use a secure backend server (like Flask, Node.js, etc.) to handle API calls and protect your API key.

Note on Data Source:
Due to the difficulty of accessing free, real-time, and comprehensive airline booking market demand data via public APIs or scraping within the given constraints, this application uses simulated data. This allows for a full demonstration of the data processing, insight generation (via Gemini API), and visualization features. For a production environment, you would need to integrate with a commercial airline data provider or develop a robust, legally compliant scraping solution.

Key Features
Simulated Data Generation: Generates realistic-looking airline booking data directly in the browser using JavaScript.

Gemini API Integration (Client-Side): Utilizes the Gemini API directly from the browser to process the simulated data and extract actionable insights.

Web App Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript for viewing and visualizing insights.

Data Visualization: Displays trends using interactive charts (powered by Chart.js).

Files Included
index.html: The main web page for the frontend.

style.css: Custom CSS for additional styling (though primarily uses Tailwind CSS).

script.js: JavaScript for frontend logic, data generation, API calls, and chart rendering.

.gitignore: Standard Git ignore file for web projects.

Setup and Deployment (GitHub Pages)
Clone the repository (or create the files manually):

# If you have a Git repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

Add your Gemini API Key:
Open static/script.js and locate the YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE placeholder. Replace it with your actual Gemini API key. Remember the security warning above!

// In static/script.js
const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"; // <--- REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR KEY

Upload to GitHub:
Upload all the files (index.html, static/style.css, static/script.js, .gitignore, README.md) to a GitHub repository.

Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to your GitHub repository settings.

Navigate to the "Pages" section (usually under "Code and automation").

Under "Source," select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., main or master) and choose the / (root) folder.

Save your changes. GitHub Pages will then build and deploy your site. It might take a few minutes for the site to become live.

Access Your App:
Once deployed, your application will be accessible at a URL like https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/.

Usage
Generate Data & Insights: Click the "Generate Data & Get Insights" button on the web page.

View Insights: The application will display the simulated raw data (for reference) and then present the insights generated by the Gemini API, followed by visualizations of popular routes and price trends.
